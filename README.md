1. - A good commit message should have some rules, e.g.:    - programmers should only commit working code
                                                            - we should only commit logical set of changes
                                                            - lenght should be defined by the individual private companies (or max 50 charachters long, usually)
                                                            - programmers should use complete sentences
                                                            - programmers should start with an issue ID (e.g coming from a Ticketing System)
                                                            - Commit messaged should be written in 'Imperative Tense'
